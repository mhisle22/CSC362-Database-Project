AGREED MEETING TIME/PLACE FOR REGULAR WEEKLY TEAM MEETINGS/WORK:

Tuesdays: 7-10pm
Thursdays: 7-10pm
Boles 004

Times will be modified based upon conflicts that may arise.
Individual work, once decided upon as a team, will be finished remotely
or in pairs depending upon complexity.


OUR PLAN FOR SUBMITTING THE DELIVERABLES:

Our team will meet biweekly to discuss overall design, work distribution,
progress, and any errors. From there, team members will either work remotely
or in pairs as decided.

[Note: The deadlines are listed below, and it is OK to leave these
unchanged.  However, your team may need to submit one or more
deliverables early due to your team members' constraints and other
commitments.  Of course, you could also choose as a team to submit a
deliverable late--but keep in mind that this will result in a reduced
score of 20 points (out of 100) per day or part of a day late.  The
reason for the penalty is to help teams stay on track and have greater
success in completing the project as a whole.]
