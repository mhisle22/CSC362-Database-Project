MISCELLANEOUS PAGES:

All smaller transitions (adding new test, etc.) that can be done in the same screen as another will be handled as a part of said
screen. Details on this will be worked out as we come upon them.

NOTE:

Our interactions with the database and the links between all of these pages will be fleshed out more in the future. This is
more of a preliminary plan than a concrete idea of what we will do.
