Dear Pete,

We have attached a few preliminary plans for the database of Acme Test Proctoring Services. 
Please review these at your earliest convenience and inform us of any changes you would like us to make. 
We would also like to ask a few more questions for clarification:

1. Is there a proctor/employee ID?
2. Are there any other individuals that we are dealing with that do that fall into the category of students, instructors, or proctors?
3. Are there other employees who are not proctors?
4. Are there specific seating arrangements?

Thank you for your time and we look forward to your feedback.

Sincerely,
Team Guns 'n Roses
